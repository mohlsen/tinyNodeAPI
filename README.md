tinyNodeAPI
===========

a tiny node site that can be used to test api requests.  Created this as all the services out there that do API mocks do not allow CORS requests, and I wanted to call a real API from plunker or JSFiddle.

##Setup
1. npm install

##Usage
node server.js

To change API responses, simple modify the route, add new ones, or just hack away in server.js.  express.io was used as maybe I'll want to do websocket stuff later. Also would be cool to have the requests
